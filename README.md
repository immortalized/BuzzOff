# 🚫 **BuzzOff** - Anti-Honey Script

**BuzzOff** is a JavaScript script designed for website owners who want to warn users about the potentially exploitative practices of the Honey extension. Honey, a popular browser extension for finding coupons, has been criticized for hijacking affiliate links and manipulating coupon codes, which undermines the integrity of the e-commerce ecosystem. This script helps inform users about these concerns and encourages them to uninstall the extension before completing their checkout.

### 💡 **Features**

- **🚨 Popup Warning:** Detects when Honey is active on a page and shows a detailed modal popup warning users about Honey’s practices.
- **⚠️ Clear Messaging:** The popup explains several concerns:
  - **Honey Doesn’t Find the Best Deals:** Honey mostly relies on user-submitted coupons and merchant partnerships, so it doesn’t always find the best available discounts.
  - **Affiliate Hijacking:** Honey overrides original affiliate links, meaning content creators and websites lose out on commissions.
  - **Coupon Manipulation:** Honey may prioritize certain coupons that benefit its business partners, rather than displaying the most valuable codes.
  - **Data Collection:** Honey collects user data during checkout, which could raise privacy concerns.
- **🎥 Embedded Video:** A YouTube video explaining the issues with Honey is embedded within the popup for additional context.
- **🎨 Custom Styling:** A sleek, user-friendly design with custom CSS ensures the warning message is clear and visually appealing.
- **❌ Close Button:** Users can easily dismiss the popup once they’ve read the message.
